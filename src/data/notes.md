### Next Steps
- find a better place for these notes
- move js code from River Snow into components and make sure that the same code can be adapted to run both multi-para *Treading Void* and single-para *River Snow* with the same js components, then
- simplify the .md files for both projects and, 
- work out, in practice, the workflow for adding other quartrains to this site, then
- integrate with new website work
