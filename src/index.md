For details of this project please read the [Prospectus](inapm0).

This is the landing page of the project’s public-facing working draft. The site is built with [Observable Framework](https://observablehq.com/framework/) and is configured to display pages that are derived, live, from Markdown and live-code notebooks on the [Observable](https://observablehq.com) platform. You are welcome to comment on or even contribute to my work on any of those notebooks that I have so-far made public. To do this, visit [the project’s landing page on the Observable platform itself](https://observablehq.com/@shadoof/inapm?collection=@shadoof/in-networked-and-programmable-media) and, if necessary, set up a free account. Apart from giving transactive access to this project and its progress, Observable is a highly interesting platform for creative coding, visualization, and collaboration.
